#
# Implements a simple queuing mechanism for exclusive resources.
# Exclusive FSM controls the exclusive resource.
# The protocol to request access to the resource is the following:
# 1. send 'request' to Exclusive
# 2. wait for a 'reply' from Exclusive
# 3. send 'complete' to Exclusive when completed using the resource
#
# This is superior to locking mechanisms since there is a queue
# of requests in the message buffer.  Each request will be handled
# in FIFO order.
#
# This does depend on getting 'complete' messages for each 'reply'
# message to keep functioning.   If no 'complete' messages are returned
# the queue will not progress.   If more than one 'complete' message
# is return for a single 'reply' then it might send a reply before
# the next 'complete' is sent.  This could be mitigated with keeping
# track of who we sent the reply to and ignoring all other complete
# messages.
